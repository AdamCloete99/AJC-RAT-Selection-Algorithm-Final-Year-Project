RAT Selection Algorithm For Multiservice Multimode Terminals in Next Generation Networks

Github repository containing the MATLAB code and Excel spreadsheets used in the UCT undergraduate thesis: RAT Selection Algorithm For Multiservice Multimode Terminals in Next Generation Networks

Input data (Supplier selection) contains the network attributes (C4:F7), service characteristics (A28:E45) and user preferences (K3:W103).User preferences are generated in User MATLAB code. Supplier selection needs to be opened and saved when new users are generated.

The normalised weights from the network attributes (C22:F25) and combined normalised weights of service characteristics and user preferences (AA3:AL103) from input data (Supplier selection) are what is used in the decision making MATLAB code.

CC results (Supplier selection) contain the results from the algorithm. The first choice (B2:CZ4), second choice (B6:CZ8) and third choice (B10:CZ12) RATs are weighed up into the conditionary tables, showing the results and a bar graph representing the data.
